                   Rimbick town itself does not have too many tourist attractions to offer. There are two trek routes which connect Rimbick with Sandakphu. One is a direct forest trail coming from Bikebhanjan to Rimbik. The other trek route reaches Rimbick via Gurdung and Srikhola. The second trek route although longer, is preferred by most trekkers. From Rimbick an uneven road takes you to Srikhola (about 7 kms) from where you can start your trek. Gurdung is just 3 kms trek from Srikhola towards Sandakphu. Some tourists prefer to trek only till Gurdung thus combining thrill of the Sandakphu trek without getting out of the Leisure tour mode altogether. Between Srikhola and Gurdung lies the small village of Timbure where tourist accommodation is also available. Srikhola and Gurdung offers basic tourist accommodations, Rimbick also has a number of basic tourist accommodations.
